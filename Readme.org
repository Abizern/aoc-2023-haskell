* aoc-2023-haskell
A Cabal project for my solutions to Advent of Code 2023 puzzles using Haskell.

** Usage
This is a cabal project with a library for each days solution and an app that runs all the solutions and prints the results.

There is a utility library which is added as a submodule.

Build and run from the root of the project using cabal
 
 To build 
 
 =cabal build all=

 While developing just use the repl and pipe data into it. To compile and run a solution for day =<d>=

 =cabal run aoc23 <d>=

** Installation
Clone the repository and the submodule.

** Testing
I'm using [[https://github.com/phadej/cabal-extras/tree/master][cabal-docspec]] installed directly, without Hackage. (I had to enable a lower version of GHC).

=cabal build all=
=cabal-docspec=

from the root of the project to run the tests.
  
** Inputs
I'm not including my inputs.

The code requires each input to be of the form =day<xx>.txt= so add the requisite ones before trying to evaluate any solution.

I use [[https://github.com/wimglenn/advent-of-code-data][aocd]] to fetch and cache the inputs for my registered user id.

To fetch all inputs run =./fetch_inputs.sh= from the project root. If they have been cached, this shouldn't take too long.
For getting individual day's inputs while participating, =cd= into the input directory for that year and run =aocd > dayxx.txt= or =aocd yyyy dd |> dayxx.txt= in the inputs directory
